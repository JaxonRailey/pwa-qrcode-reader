# PWA QR Code Reader

Progressive Web Apps (**PWA**) are a hybrid between web applications and mobile applications, in fact they are developed as web applications but with additional features, made available thanks to the use of **Service Worker**, a script that is located between the server and the browser.

In this repo I show how to familiarize yourself with the Service Worker to allow the web app to work even offline and to be *installed* on the Home screen of the device.

To scan the qr code I used **[instascan](https://github.com/schmich/instascan)** library.

You can try it here: **[QR Code Reader](https://qrcode-reader-tool.netlify.app/)**
